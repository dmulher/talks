# fp-guild-20251007

### Description
Here is the code used for my FP Guild talk on 2025/10/07.

I've also included the excalidraw I used and the script as well, which I very frequently diverted from.

The inspiration of this talk came from chapter 1.3 of SICP.

### Replication Instructions

To run the code examples, you will need to install GHC ([here](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/)), and then run `ghci` to enter the environment.

Once you've done that, you can load any of the modules by running
```haskell
:l moduleName
```
for example
```haskell
:l maths
```
which will load that module into the environment, giving you access to anything defined within.
